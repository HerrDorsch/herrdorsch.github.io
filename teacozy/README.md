# Codecademy Teacozy Project (Unit 4 - Display and Positioning)

My adaption of the Teacozy project. I tried to figure out the CSS/HTML code by myself. Worked for approx. 95%. The rest was covered by lurking into the source of the project page.

My git and github usage during development was below anything healthy. So please bare with my lazy default script descriptions.

Thanks for watching,
Have a wonderful time!
